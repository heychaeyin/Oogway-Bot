Grief is the price we pay for love.
The wound is the place where the Light enters you
There is no grief like the grief that does not speak.
What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us
There are no goodbyes for us. Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart.
The reality is that you will grieve forever. You will not ‘get over’ the loss of a loved one; you will learn to live with it. You will heal and you will rebuild yourself around the loss you have suffered. You will be whole again but you will never be the same. Nor should you be the same, nor would you want to.
Grief is like the ocean; it comes on waves ebbing and flowing. Sometimes the water is calm, and sometimes it is overwhelming. All we can do is learn to swim.
Grief is not a sign of weakness, nor a lack of faith. It is the price of love.
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.
The truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.

The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another.

Pride is holding your head up when everyone around you is letting theirs hang.

Stress is nothing more than a socially acceptable form of mental illness.
In times of great stress or adversity, it's always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive.
It's not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it.
There is no such thing as stress. The mind cannot process a thing called 'stress.' It can only process thoughts. So when you think the word 'stress,' all your mind hears is 'tenseness.'
Thinking about something doesn't have to lead to stress. It all depends on how you think about it.
Stress is an ignorant state. It believes that everything is an emergency. Nothing is that important.
The best way to reduce the stress in your life is to accept the fact that there are things that are out of your control.
Acknowledge your feelings and accept that they are valid.
Don't try to push your feelings away - allow yourself to fully experience them.
Don't beat yourself up - be kind and understanding towards yourself.
Seek out support from others if you need it.
Talk about what you're going through - it can be helpful to express yourself.

If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.
There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed.
Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.
The way is not in the sky. The way is in the heart.
In the World through which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself. 
There is no path to happiness: happiness is the path.
A surprise is like a present: the more you give, the more you get. 
Surprises are wonderful things. Putting them together is an art. 
Surprise is the greatest gift which life can grant us. 
Surprises shouldn't be given lightly - they're meant to be special, not commonplace.
Surprises are the best kind of happiness. 
Surprise is the greatest joy in life.
Surprise is the soul of joy.
Surprise is the antechamber to joy.
Surprise is the spice of life. 
Surprise is the greatest expression of affection.
Life is a journey, not a destination.
What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
I cannot change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
You can't control the direction of the wind, but you can adjust your sails.
