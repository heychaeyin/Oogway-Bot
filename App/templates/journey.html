              This project we all collectively named the Oogway Bot was created with the intent of creating a AI bot that will provide emotional and philosophical support to the user based on sentiment analysis of the user's input based on given input data from a Reddit/Go Emotions dataset that we saw fit. On our secondhand, we got a much smaller dataset from OpenAI where we asked it for emotional quotes which followed suite with the GoEmotions emotion list. Thereby generating emotional responses from user input, we extracted the emotion from which is then matched with every single quote we got from OpenAI If any quote matched the emotional analysis of the user input phrase, that quote or quotes are then added to a list where the computer prints out a random index of that list and gives you the quote you desire.

               Collecting & Processing  Data
              </h2>
              <p style='line-height:2em'>
              For our project, we wanted to find data that included a sentence as well as a corresponding emotion. We found our first dataset on Kaggle, which provided us with inspiration on how to format the data to feed to the model. Each observation would include a sentence, followed by a semi-colon, and then the corresponding emotion. However, that data proved to be some garbage-in garbage-out. That sent us back to the drawing board, in search of new data. The divine beings blessed us with a GoEmotions dataset that used sentences/phrases from Reddit (that actually made sense-mostly) and was appropriately tagged with emotions. The hard part then was formatting the data, since it was in the form of three csv files. We had to filter out unnecessary labels, as well as turn the data into a txt file. In the end, we had a text file that contained approximately 158k sentences that we could train our model on. Lastly, we used OpenAI in order to generate 10 pieces of advice per emotion in the dataset.

              <p style='line-height:2em'>
                For this project, we are utilizing a GPT-2 Model that is loaded through aitextgen. The first week of the camp was us spending lots of time trying to figure out how to set up and train a model correctly. We experimented with the different parameters of the train function, and encountered difficulties while trying to save our progress. By the second week, we had a set training regiment for our model using the '124M' version of GPT-2: <strong>line_by_line = <em>True</em>, learning_rate = <em>0.001</em>, and num_steps = <em>10000</em></strong>. Training the model once took about an hour. Every time that we wanted to retrain the model, we would load the previous training data from the pytorch_model.bin file. In total, we trained the model about six times.

            Building the Website
          </h2>
          <p style='line-height:2em'>
            Building the website wasn't the greatest of times. None of us really had any major experience with web development, so we tried to learn the basics of html and css before the third week. Despite this, we still spent the first couple days trying to figure out what we were doing as well as trying to find a bootstrap template that would best fit our project. Once we started to get the hang of things, we divided the work among everyone, with some people on specific pages, some creating custom drawings, and others working on implementing the model onto the page. We all agreed that the most frustrating part of working on web development was all the little errors that seemed simple to fix, but in reality, took us a long time to finally find out what was wrong. However, building the website was definitely a process that we all learned a lot from, and we all enjoyed everything that the camp has had to offer.

We also would focus on learning different things; some of the team went more in depth into learning how to code whilst others would plan out how to present our end product.
